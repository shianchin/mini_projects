# Customizable Scientific Calculator
The objective of this assignment is to enhance the skills (designing and programming) of the students to solve problem using the C++ programming language. Students are required to design a Customizable Scientific Calculator.

The customizable calculator must be able to perform the following functions:
* A file to add mathematical formulas (Example: circumference and area of a circle)
* Calculate basic mathematical functions (x + y, x - y, x / y, x * y, x pow y)
* Able to retrieve the mathematical formula stored in the text file for calculation
* Able to accept decimal and floating-point inputs
* Must be able to calculate any amount of variables
* Able to accept variable in place of decimal values when inputting formula equation (Example: a + a + 10) and later on identify the variables before asking for user input


The calculator should also handle Polynomial Calculation as follows:
The internal representation of a Polynomial is an array of terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponent. The term has the coefficient 2 and the exponent 4.

##Capabilities

a) The addition operator (+) to add two Polynomials.

b) The subtraction operator (-) to subtract two Polynomials.

c) The assignment operator to assign one Polynomial to another.

d) The addition assignment operator (+=) and subtraction assignment operator (-=).

e) Able to accept input of the variable to calculate the overall value of the equation.
